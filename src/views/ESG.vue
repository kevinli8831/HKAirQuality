        <h1>What is ESG?</h1>
        <p>
          ESG is often conflated or used interchangeably with the term
          <b> “sustainable investing”</b>

          . We see sustainable investing as the umbrella and ESG as a data
          toolkit for identifying and informing our solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          ESG data is most often categorized as “non-accounting” information
          because it captures components important for valuations that are not
          traditionally reported. The valuation of companies has become more
          complex, with a growing portion tied up in intangible assets. ESG
          metrics provide insights into these intangibles, such as brand value
          and reputation, by measuring decisions taken by company management
          that affect operational efficiency and future strategic directions.

        <h1>ESG Investing Trends</h1>
        <p>
          As ESG investing accelerates in demand, several key trends are
          emerging – from climate change to social unrest. The coronavirus
          pandemic, in particular, has intensified discussions about the
          interconnectedness of sustainability and the financial system. CFA
          Institute is leading the financial industry by producing valuable
          research, convening experts and practitioners for discussion, and
          setting standards to enable the mainstreaming of ESG investing.

          <h1>ESG Factors</h1>
          <p>
            There is no one exhaustive list of ESG examples. ESG factors are
            often interlinked, and it can be challenging to classify an ESG
            issue as only an environmental, social, or governance issue, as the
            table below shows.
          </p>
          <p>
            These ESG factors can often be measured (e.g., what the employee
            turnover for a company is), but it can be difficult to assign them a
            monetary value (e.g., what the cost of employee turnover for a
            company is).
