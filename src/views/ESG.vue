        <h1>What is ESG?</h1>
        <p>
          ESG is often conflated or used interchangeably with the term
          <b> “sustainable investing”</b>

          . We see sustainable investing as the umbrella and ESG as a data
          toolkit for identifying and informing our solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          ESG data is most often categorized as “non-accounting” information
          because it captures components important for valuations that are not
          traditionally reported. The valuation of companies has become more
          complex, with a growing portion tied up in intangible assets. ESG
          metrics provide insights into these intangibles, such as brand value
          and reputation, by measuring decisions taken by company management
          that affect operational efficiency and future strategic directions.
